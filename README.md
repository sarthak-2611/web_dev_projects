# Profile Card – Sarthak Singh

A simple profile card webpage built using **HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript**.  
This was made as a practice project after learning basic web development.

## Features

- Profile picture with my name and branch (ECE at LNMIIT)
- Short education section using a table
- Skills list (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, AI)
- Links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles
- Simple contact form with a JavaScript alert (demo only, it does not send real emails)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript 

## Future Improvements

- Connect the form to a real backend or email service.
- Make the design more responsive for very small screens.
- Add more sections like projects or hobbies.
